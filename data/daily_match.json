  "fact_text": "In 1951, deep in the Idaho desert, the Experimental Breeder Reactor I quietly lit up four modest light bulbs, becoming the first nuclear power plant to generate electricity. That tiny pool of warm, artificial starlight marked a shift from theory to a new era of harnessing atomic forces for power, forever changing how humans imagined their energy future.",
