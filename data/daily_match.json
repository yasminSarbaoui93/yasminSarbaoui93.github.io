  "fact_text": "On 20 December 1951, in the remote town of Arco, Idaho, the Experimental Breeder Reactor I quietly made history by becoming the first nuclear power plant to generate electricity—just enough to light four humble bulbs. Those small glowing filaments marked a threshold moment, transforming the abstract terror and promise of the atom into a tangible, man-made star burning indoors.",

  "match_reason": "The first nuclear plant lighting four bulbs is essentially humanity’s original controlled \"electric shock\" from the atom—small, experimental, but charged with possibility. Episode #05 mirrors that moment with high-voltage guitars and crackling energy, turning the birth of nuclear electricity into a blues-rock surge that feels like plugging Earth’s early atomic glow straight into an amplifier.",
